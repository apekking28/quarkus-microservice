# Quarkus Microservices Development

## Project Description
This project is about developing a microservices architecture using the Quarkus framework. The focus of the project revolves around two main services: the Person Service and the Book Service. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a system that can manage information about individuals (persons) and books separately, with the potential for continuous development in the future.

## **Person Service**
The Person Service is responsible for managing information related to individuals within the system. Some of the features to be developed within this service include:
- Registering new individuals with details such as name, address, date of birth, etc.
- Searching and displaying individual details based on specific criteria.
- Updating information of registered individuals.
- Removing individuals from the system.
- Integrating with other services (such as the Book Service) to establish inter-service relationships.

## **Book Service**
The Book Service is tasked with managing information related to books within the system. Some of the features to be developed within this service include:
- Registering new books with details such as title, author, publication year, etc.
- Searching and displaying book details based on various parameters.
- Adding reviews or ratings for specific books.
- Categorizing books based on genres or categories.
- Interconnecting with the Person Service to indicate book owners and borrower information.

**Technology and Development:**
This project will utilize Quarkus as the primary framework for developing the microservices. Quarkus is renowned for its high performance, memory efficiency, and full support for Java. These services will be containerized using Docker to facilitate development, distribution, and scalability.

## Ongoing development will involve
- Implementing security and authorization layers.
- Handling errors and tracing mechanisms.
- Performance optimization through caching and other mechanisms.
- Integrating with databases, possibly using Hibernate or cloud-based database services.
- Utilizing monitoring and logging tools to oversee the overall health of the system.
- Expanding functionality by adding new services, such as a Borrowing Service or Recommendation Service.

## **Final Outcome**
The final outcome of this project will be a microservices system consisting of the Person and Book services, developed using Quarkus. This system will be capable of managing individual and book information separately, with the potential for further development as needed. With a microservices architecture, this project will enable scalability, easy maintenance, and the potential to adapt to changing requirements in the future.
